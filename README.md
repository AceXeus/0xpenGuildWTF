## **Development Guidelines**  

- Fork the repo : https://github.com/AceXeus/0xpenGuildWTF  


## **Mission**  

To create an innovative and unique platform that:  

- Empowers users to create, mint, and trade NFTs effortlessly.  
- Encourages creativity and rewards community contributions.  
- Bridges the gap between two distinct blockchain cultures, fostering collaboration and interaction.  


## **Key Features**  

1. **A Cross-Culture NFT Marketplace**  
   - Seamlessly integrates Ethereum and Polkadot, allowing communities from both chains to interact.  
   - Provides a unified space for users to exchange ideas, culture, and digital assets.  

2. **Randomized NFT Minting Mechanism**  
   - Users can mint NFTs with attributes, rarity levels, and values that are entirely randomized.  
   - NFTs are categorized into rarity tiers: Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, with special rewards for rare mints.  

3. **Platform Token and Reward System**  
   - Platform tokens reward the most active participants:  
     - Top Minters: Users who mint the most NFTs.  
     - Top Creators: NFT creators with the highest XP scores.  
   - Gas Fees distribution:  
     - 70% to the collection’s reward pool for creators of special NFTs.  
     - 30% to the platform’s token pool for rewarding contributors.  

4. **Gamification and Community Engagement**  
   - Users can earn tokens or items by completing tasks or participating in events.  
   - Limited-time minting events drive engagement and FOMO.  

5. **Value for Users**  
   - **For Creators:** Tools for minting NFTs, access to both communities, and platform token rewards.  
   - **For Collectors:** Exciting randomized minting experiences and ownership of rare NFTs.  
   - **For the Community:** Collaboration between Ethereum and Polkadot, enhancing NFT liquidity.  


## **Technical Stack**
